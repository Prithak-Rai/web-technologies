                <strong>Elon Reeve Musk</strong> FRS (/ˈiːlɒn/ EE-lon; born June 28, 1971) is a business magnate and investor.
                He is the founder, CEO and chief engineer[b] of SpaceX; angel investor, CEO and product architect
                 of Tesla, Inc.; founder of The Boring Company; co-founder of Neuralink and OpenAI; president of

            <dd>
                <em>Musk was born and grew up in Pretoria, South Africa. He attended the University of Pretoria before 
                moving to Canada at age 17, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later,
                 he matriculated at Queen's University and transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he 
                 received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford 
                 University, but dropped out after two days to instead pursue a business career, co-founding the web software
                  company Zip2 with his brother Kimbal; the startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999.
